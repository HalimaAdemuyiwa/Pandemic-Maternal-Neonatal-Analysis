# # Impact of pandemic lockdown on maternal and neonatal health outcomes in low-resource settings
# INTRODUCTION
The covid-19 pandemic led to the implementation of lockdown measures to spread infection. These measures, however, disrupted access to essential healthcare services particularly maternal and neonatal care in low resources settings. Movement restrictions and strain on healthcare facilities limited access to antenatal care and skilled delivery services.
This study assesses the impact of pandemic lockdown measures on maternal mortality, neonatal health outcomes and the role of telemedicine in improving health accessibility.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Lockdown measures disrupted access to maternal and neonatal healthcare services, potentially increasing maternal and neonatal mortality. This project seeks to quantify these Changes and assessment whether telemedicine helped during the lockdown period.
# DATA DESCRIPTIN
The data contains 100 records representing maternal and neonatal healthcare outcomes across lockdown and pre-lockdown periods. Key variables include period, maternal deaths, neonatal deaths and telemedicine use (yes/ no). 
# ANALYSIS & VISUALIZATION
PivotTables and pivot charts were used to summarize number of antenatal visits, facilities deliveries, maternal deaths, neonatal deaths, staff shortage, and telemedicine use by period. A dashboard was created to visually compare outcomes between lockdown and pre-lockdown periods.

# KEY INSIGHTS 
•Antenatal visits were significantly higher in the pre-lockdown period (11,666)
compared to the lockdown period (1,817).
•	Facility -based deliveries declined from 8,375 before lockdown to 1,242 during lockdown.
•	Maternal and neonatal deaths were higher during the lockdown period compared to pre-lockdown period.
•	Staff shortages were reported more frequently. Pre-lockdown (25 cases) than during lockdown (6 cases)
•	Telemedicine was adopted in 36 healthcare during the lockdown and helped improve healthcare accessibility
 
# CONCLUSION
The analysis shows that pandemic lockdown measures negatively affected maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Telemedicine emerged as an important tool to improve healthcare accessibility during period of restricted movement.
